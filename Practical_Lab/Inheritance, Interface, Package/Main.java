/**
 * Assume you want to capture shapes, which can be either 
 * circles (with a radius and a color) or rectangles (with a 
 * length, width, and color). You also want to be able to 
 * create signs (to post in the campus center, for example),
 * each of which has a shape (for the background of the sign) 
 * and the text (a String) to put on the sign. Create classes 
 * and interfaces for circles, rectangles, shapes, and signs. 
 * Write a program that illustrates the significance of
 * interface default method.
