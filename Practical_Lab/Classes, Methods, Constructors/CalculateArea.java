 * Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members

 * perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its constructor
 * having parameters for length and breadth is used to
 * initialize length and breadth of the rectangle. Let class
 * 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its constructor
 * having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the
 * constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. Print the area
 * and perimeter of a rectangle and a square. Also use array
 * of objects.
